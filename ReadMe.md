In this project, unsupervised machine learning method is used to evaluate the hazard of submarine landslide. 

- Data file:
    - Data.txt
      The document contains nine factors that affect the risk of submarine landslide, including wave height, bearing capacity, scour, maximum velocity of bottom layer, area affected by engineering activities, slope, liquefaction, water depth and sediment type. Each influence factor is divided into four categories.

- Code files:
  - 1kmeans_new.py 
  - 2spe_cluster_new.py
  - 3Hierarchical Clustering.py
  - 4danyinzi_new.py

The first three codes are used for classification evaluation of unsupervised machine learning. The fourth code is used to compare the importance of different impact factors.
